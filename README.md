**Catalyst** is the composable, fully customizable headless commerce framework for
[BigCommerce](https://www.bigcommerce.com/). Catalyst is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), uses
our [React](https://react.dev/) storefront components, and is backed by the
[GraphQL Storefront API](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/docs/storefront/graphql).

By choosing Catalyst, you'll have a fully-functional storefront within a few seconds, and spend zero time on wiring
up APIs or building SEO, Accessibility, and Performance-optimized ecommerce components you've probably written many
times before. You can instead go straight to work building your brand and making this your own.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Catalyst Storefront is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out the [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you just want to build a storefront, start with the [CLI](#quickstart) which will install the Next.js application in [/core](/core/).
> If you wish to contribute back to Catalyst or create a fork of Catalyst, you can check the [docs for this monorepo](https://catalyst.dev/docs/monorepo) to get started.
=======
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
